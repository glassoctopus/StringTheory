String Theory, by Thomas McMahon

Overview:

Social media platforms often fail to adequately inform users of the permanence and potential dangers of their posts. To address this, I've designed an innovative social app that highlights these issues by design.

Purpose:

This application serves as an artistic commentary on the futility of social media, the enduring nature of online content, and as a demonstration of my skills in full stack development.

Features:

Post and Connect: 

Create posts and link them to others to initiate conversations. Full CRUD, there is delete functinality but it is not accesible through the interface.  

Transparency: 

All edits to posts are visible, and deletion is not allowed, emphasizing the permanence of online content.


Development:
String Theory is my first full stack application. It is a work in progress, and I will continue to refine it. For now, please disregard any data that is obviously for debugging purposes.

Try It Out:

You can explore the app on Netlify. Feel free to create a user profile and make posts:  https://stringtheorys.netlify.app 

Getting Started:

If you would like to run the project locally, clone the repository and use the command npm run dev to get started. The backend is powered by Firebase.
