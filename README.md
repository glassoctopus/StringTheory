# String Theory, by Thomas McMahon

Sometimes we make our Problems ;^)

Social Media apps do not visually or instructionally inform you of how persistent or dangerous they are. Why not make a social app that illustrates this by design?

This App is artistic commentary on the futility of social media, the permanence of things on the internet, and demonstrating my ability to make a full stack app.

Solution to self made problem 8^)

Make Posts and string to others. Have a conversation. Do I have time to make it vuisually intresting?

With Only one stipulation, all edits are visible. No deletion, ever. The internet is more permanent than we take for granted.

See the deployed App on netlify, please make a user profile and a posts. https://stringtheorys.netlify.app

If you pull it down, it's an npm run dev to get going.
I am using firebase for this backend.
