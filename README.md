Sometimes we make our Problems ;^)

Social Media apps do not visually or instructionally inform you of how persistent or dangerous they are. Why not make a social app that illustrates this by design?

This App is artistic commentary on the futility of social media, the permanence of things on the internet, and demonstrating my ability to make a full stack app.

Solution to self made problem 8^)

Make Posts and string to others. Have a conversation. Do I have time to make it vuisually intresting?

only stipulation, all edits are visible. no deletion, ever. Internet is more permanent than we take for granted.

My overall concept is creating a way that anyone can see anyone's posts, no friends or likes, just the history of humans interacting.

Ideally I will be able to create a “canvas” not and actual html canvas, that will have visibility to all user’s posts, by panning around the scene (no scroll bars.) Just javascript code to right (or left) click and grab the screen and move it like a figma or db diagram.

See the deployed App on netlify, please make a user profile and a posts. https://stringtheorys.netlify.app

If you pull it down, it's an npm run dev to get going.
I am using firebase for this backend.
